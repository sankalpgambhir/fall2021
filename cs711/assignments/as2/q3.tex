\question
Since the question asks to pick points for arbitrarily large n, it is assumed
here that the field itself is sufficiently large to allow picking points
arbitrarily.

Consider for any set of \(t\) distinct points in \(\field^2\), their evaluation
over a polynomial in \(\field[x, y]\) with degree \(n \geq 2\),

\begin{gather*}
    \forall i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, t\}\; P(\alpha_i, \beta_i) = \sum_{j + k < n; j, k \geq 0} a_{jk} \alpha_i^j \beta_i^k ~.
\end{gather*}

We can write this as the (generally) non-homogeneous linear system

\begin{gather*}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \alpha_1^0\beta_1^0 & \alpha_1^0\beta_1^1 & \ldots & \alpha_1^0\beta_1^n & \alpha_1^1\beta_1^0 & \ldots & \alpha_1^n\beta_1^0 \\
        \alpha_2^0\beta_2^0 & \alpha_2^0\beta_2^1 & \ldots & \alpha_2^0\beta_2^n & \alpha_2^1\beta_2^0 & \ldots & \alpha_2^n\beta_2^0 \\
        &&& \vdots &&& \\
        \alpha_t^0\beta_t^0 & \alpha_t^0\beta_t^1 & \ldots & \alpha_t^0\beta_t^n & \alpha_t^1\beta_t^0 & \ldots & \alpha_t^n\beta_t^0 \\
    \end{pmatrix}_{t \times \binom{n+2}{2}}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        a_{00}\\
        a_{01}\\
        \vdots\\
        a_{n0}
    \end{pmatrix}_{\binom{n+2}{2}\times 1}
    = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        P(\alpha_1, \beta_1) \\
        P(\alpha_2, \beta_2) \\
        \vdots \\
        P(\alpha_t, \beta_t) \\
    \end{pmatrix}_{t\times 1}~.
\end{gather*}

Conversely, we can replace \(P(\alpha_i, \beta_i)\) by \(\lambda_i\) and look
for the parameters \(a_{jk}\) which describe the interpolating polynomial. Our
problem reduces to showing that there exists a pair of a \(t \times n^2\) matrix
and a \(t\)-vector such that the system has no solutions, i.e. no interpolating
polynomial exists, for sufficiently bounded t (\(\leq \binom{n+2}{2}\) as
given).

Consider \(\beta_i = 0 \;\forall i\). This is a univariate interpolation with the
linear system

\begin{gather*}
    \sum_{j = 0}^n a_{j0}\alpha_i^j, i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, t\}~.
\end{gather*}

Choose \(t\) such that \(n+1 < t \leq \binom{n+2}{2}\). This is clearly a
(possibly highly) overdetermined system. We can construct a set of input points
that have no solution as follows: pick the first \(n+1\) points arbitrarily.
These produce a \underline{unique} solution for the coefficients
\(P\{a_{j0}\}\). Construct the next \((t-n-1)\) points such that they explicitly
violate the constructed (univariate) polynomial, i.e., \(\lambda_j \not =
P(\alpha_j, 0)\) for atleast one \(j \in \{n+2, \ldots, t\}\) 
% (this set is non-empty iff \(n+1<\binom{n+2}{2}\) i.e., \(n>2\))
. Obviously, this system has no solution. This produces the required set of
points.
