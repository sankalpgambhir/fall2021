    To compute for each \(i\),

    \begin{gather*}
        u_i = \frac{1}{\prod_{j\not = i}(\alpha_i - \alpha_j)}
    \end{gather*}

    divide the denominator into two products of size \(\approx \frac{n}{2}\).
    Combining these is clearly one multiplication, i.e. \(\order{1}\). The
    division itself is a constant order field operation, so I just compute the
    product first. This has the time complexity recurrence

    \begin{gather*}
        T(n) = 2T(\frac{n}{2}) + \order{1}~.
    \end{gather*}

    We obtain the total complexity \(\order{\log n}\). Since there are \(n\)
    such quantities to be computed, we get the total complexity to be
    \(\order{n\log n}\).

    Suppose we break the problem into instead interpolating two sets of
    \(\frac{n}{2}\) points, with results \(f_1\) and \(f_2\), and writing

    \begin{gather*}
        f(x) = f_1(x) g_1(x) + f_2(x)g_2(x)\\
        g_1(x) = \prod_{i \leq \frac{n}{2}} (x-\alpha_i)\\
        g_2(x) = \prod_{i > \frac{n}{2}} (x-\alpha_i)
    \end{gather*}

    The base case is the Lagrange interpolation for a single point.

    We can precompute the \(g\) polynomials, and knowing them, the larger
    problem can be computed in \(\order{n\log^2 n}\) since it has the time
    complexity recurrence relation

    \begin{gather*}
        T(n) = 2T(\frac{n}{2}) + \order{n\log n + n}~.
    \end{gather*}

    As for the precomputation, construct the tree with leaves as
    \((x-\alpha_i)\) and the layers above them constructed as the products of
    pairs of the elements of the previous layer. Clearly, these are exactly the
    \(g\) polynomials required. The time recurrence relation again, with the
    combination step being the multiplication of two \(\frac{n}{2}\) degree
    polynomials, is

    \begin{gather*}
        T(n) = 2T(\frac{n}{2}) + \order{n\log n}~.
    \end{gather*}

    Total time complexity is thus their sum \(\order{n\log^2 n} = \order{n\poly \log n}\).
